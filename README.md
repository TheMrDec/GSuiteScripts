# GSuiteScripts
A brief collection of useful Google Apps Scripts

# Usage
These scripts are intended to be copied into a new Google Apps Script project and set up from there.

Each script has a list of what services need to be activated in order for them to function properly and a recommended trigger scheme.
The recommended trigger scheme will be created automatically so if you would like an alternate trigger sceme, please create it manually and DO NOT RUN INIT!

# Warnings
Please understand that these scripts were written in my spare time to assist me in my full time job. If you see an issue with the scripts, feel free to make a PR, but please dont expect me to respond quickly.

Also, these scripts come with absolutely no guarantees. You are responsible for running a debug pass to ensure you don't wreak havoc on your domain. 
Don't run scripts you find on the internet if you can't understand their function!
